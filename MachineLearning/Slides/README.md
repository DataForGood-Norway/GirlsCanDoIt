Girls Can Do: Machine Learning!

# Slides notebook

In this folder you can find the Jupyter Notebook we used to make the slideshow.

## Play it!
We recommend going through it:
1. in a browser, following **[this link](http://dataforgood.no/GirlsCanDoIt/MachineLearning/Slides/#/)**,
2. or using [`RISE`](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/customize.html)
 installed locally to play the notebook as a `reveal.js` (html presentation).

## Run it!
You can run it:
1. locally in a more "notebook form" after installing the requirements,
2. or [via CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/MachineLearning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb).
