Girls Can Do: Machine Learning!

# Lab Notebooks

In this folder you can find the Jupyter Notebooks you can run locally, or opening as CoLab notebooks using these links:

- for Linear Regression: [follow this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/MachineLearning/Lab/Linear%20Regression%20Example.ipynb)
- for Clustering: [follow this other link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/MachineLearning/Lab/Clustering%20Example.ipynb)


## To run notebooks locally: manual setup
If you want to clone the repository/download the notebooks and run the code locally, you'll need to install Python and some libraries (or just install Anaconda, we'll see how).

### Useful (general) info
You can also open *any* Jupyter Notebook hosted on GitHub using CoLaboratory this way:
* Find the url to your notebook on Github (e.g. [https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/MachineLearning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/MachineLearning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb))
* Replace the beginning `https://github.com/` with `https://colab.research.google.com/github/`
* Open the resulting link: [https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/MachineLearning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/MachineLearning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb) will simply open your notebook in Google Drive using [CoLaboratory by Google](https://colab.research.google.com/).
