# Girls Can Do: Machine Learning!

Material for the workshop.


## Ready-to-go setup

If you want to run the code we will go through in our lab session right away, without installing anything, you can do it in your web browser.
Just follow the links [we provided here](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/tree/master/MachineLearning/Lab) for the presentation.

### Useful (general) info
You can open *any* Jupyter Notebook hosted on GitHub this way:
* find the url to your notebook on Github (e.g. [https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/MachineLearning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/MachineLearning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb))
* replace the beginning `https://github.com/` with `https://colab.research.google.com/github/`
* Open the resulting link: [https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/MachineLearning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/MachineLearning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb) will simply open your notebook in Google Drive using [CoLaboratory by Google](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Manual setup
If you want to clone the repository/download the notebooks and run the code locally, you'll need to install the requirements.
