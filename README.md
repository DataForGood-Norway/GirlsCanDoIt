# Girls Can Do It
Getting more girls and women to code, through workshops and mentoring.

### Girls Can Do: Machine Learning!

Material for the workshop.
For now, to play the notebooks in _Slides_ as `reveal.js` (html presentation), we
use [`RISE`](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/customize.html)
("Live" Reveal.js Jupyter/IPython Slideshow Extension) installed locally.

If you just want to test any notebook in your web browser:

* find the url to your notebook on Github (e.g. [https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb))
* replace the beginning `https://github.com/` with `https://colab.research.google.com/github/`
* Open the resulting link: [https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataForGood-Norway/GirlsCanDoIt/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Slides/Girls%20Can%20Do%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb) will simply open your notebook in Google Drive using [CoLaboratory by Google](https://colab.research.google.com/).
