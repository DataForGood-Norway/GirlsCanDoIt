# Girls Can Do It
Getting more girls and women to code, through workshops and mentoring.

### Girls Can Do: Machine Learning!
Material for the workshop.
For now, to play the notebooks in _Slides_ as `reveal.js` (html presentation), we
use [`RISE`](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/customize.html)
("Live" Reveal.js Jupyter/IPython Slideshow Extension) installed locally.
